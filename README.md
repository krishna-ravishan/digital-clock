Topic: Creating a dynamic digital clock using HTML CSS and JS

In this project, we learnt about the purpose of each meta tag, how to center elements vertically and horizontally, create basic styling for all of the elemnents, using the document object module to get elements by id using its respective function, creating a function, using the date constructor and its methods, applying conditions to suit the digital clocks needs and finally using the setTimeout method to repeatedly call a function every second.
